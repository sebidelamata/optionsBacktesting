## Abstract

In this first post in a series analyzing real-world derivatives data, we set up a Raspberry Pi 4 with a R Shiny Server. R and shell scripts are used to create a table within the PostgreSQL to hold options data. Additional scripts and a cronjob are used to automate scraping data from the CBOE open access API and appending the data to the table in the PostgreSQL database. An R markdown is used to take an initial look at our data.
